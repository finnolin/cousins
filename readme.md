## Features

### World Generation

The world is shaped by **Lithosphere** for realistic terrain, combined with **WWOO** and **Regions Unexplored** for diverse biome generation.

### Visuals

**Distant Horizons** dramatically increases render distance, letting you take in the beautiful vistas from afar.

We've included a custom fork of **Complementary Shaders** with improved compatibility for modded foliage.
